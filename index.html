<h2>Arsenal transfer news and rumours: Declan Rice, Jurrien Timber, Romeo Lavia latest</h2>
<ol>
  <li> <h3>Arsenal want £50m for Balogun | Partey attracting interest</h3> </li>
  <p>With Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber set to join, Arsenal are now turning their focus towards securing transfers for players not in Mikel Arteta's plans.

    Folarin Balogun, Nicolas Pepe, Nuno Tavares, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Cedric Soares are all available.
    
    There is huge interest in Balogun from clubs around Europe - including AC Milan, Marseille and Monaco - but no official offers have been submitted for the striker, who Arsenal value at £50m.</p>
    
    <p>There is also interest among European clubs in Thomas Partey, who has two years remaining on his contract.

      Arsenal have not ruled out returning to the market should they generate enough money from sales.
      
      The club have been looking at strengthening their right-sided attacking options throughout the last few windows, while recruiting another midfielder has not been ruled out should Partey leave.</p>
    <li> <h3>Arsenal start season against Nottingham Forest</h3></li>
    <p>Arsenal will start their 2023/24 Premier League season at home to Nottingham Forest on Saturday August 12.

      The Gunners then face two London derbies against Crystal Palace and Fulham before hosting Manchester United in their first 'Big Six' match of the season in on September 3, live on Sky Sports.
      
      The first north London derby of the season takes place at the Emirates Stadium on September 24, live on Sky Sports, with the return fixture on April 27 - the fourth last game of the campaign.</p>
      
      <p>Arsenal are expected to confirm the signing of Jurrien Timber, with the club hopeful of including the defender in their squad for their friendly away to FC Nurnberg on Thursday.

        Timber has completed his medical ahead of his £38m transfer from Ajax and the paperwork is being finalised on a long-term contract.
        
        The Gunners will pay £34m up front for Timber, with the remainder of the fee made up in performance-related add-ons.
        
        Timber is being signed as a right-back - a role that was predominantly fulfilled by Ben White last season - but can also play at centre-back, and has previously attracted interest from Manchester United.</p>
